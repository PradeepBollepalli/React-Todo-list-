 # Introduction:
 
  This documentation outlines the process of cloning a React Todo List application repository, creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, running the application in a Docker container, and pushing the code to GitHub 
  and the Docker image to Docker Hub.

# Prerequisites:

   1.Docker installed on your machine.
 
   2.Git installed on your machine.
 
   3.A Docker Hub account.
 
   4.A GitHub account.



# Cloning the Repository

   1.Open your terminal or command prompt.

   2.Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository

   3.Clone the repository:
   

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cecc63f8-9b44-4d4d-8937-49ae722e37e9)

   4.Navigate into the cloned directory:

# Pushing Code to GitHub

  Make sure you are in the project directory.
   
  I.Initialize Git if it hasnâ€™t been initialized:
 
   1. git init


  II. Add the remote repository:

  git remote add origin https://github.com/PradeepBollepalli/React-Todo-list-.git

  III. Stage all changes:

  git add .

IV. Commit your changes:
